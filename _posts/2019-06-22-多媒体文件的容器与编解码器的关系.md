# 多媒体文件的容器与编解码器的关系

音视频文件的格式各类繁多，但我们在说格式的时候，一般是指文件后缀，比如 `.mp3` `.mp4`。

从编程的角度来说，一个多媒体文件包含两部分，[容器（container）](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_container_format) 与[编解码算法（codec）](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec)，容器便是多媒体文件中众多数据的封装后对外的呈现，表现出来就是文件的扩展名，而编解码算法，则是播放该多媒体文件所需要和使用的算法。具体来说，

- **容器** 可看成是一个盒子，里面存放了该多媒体文件的所有信息，比如视频，包含音频和视频数据及相应所使用的编解码算法，以及其他视频相关的元数据，比如标题，作者信息，字幕文件等。同样是视频文件，如果根据所包含的音频及视频各类的不同，会形成不同的容器。容器体现在文件的扩展名上，对用户来说比较显而易见。常见的容器包括 OGG, Matroska, AVI, MPEG。

- **编解码算法** 是多媒体文件中数据所使用的编码算法，这体现在，你需要有一个支持相应编码的解码器，才能播放得了。这里算法的作用主要体现在压缩原始的媒体信息，使之在一个合理可接受的范围内，方便全输与使用。已经存在的压缩算法各类繁多，他们对不同类型的数据有各有优缺点，所以不能说哪种算法是最优的，只有最适合的。

|Flash Video (FLV)|.flv|FLV|VP6, Sorenson Spark, Screen video, Screen video 2, H.264|MP3, ADPCM, Nellymoser, Speex, AAC|Use of the H.264 and AAC compression formats in the FLV file format has some limitations and authors of Flash Player strongly encourage everyone to embrace the new standard F4V file format[2] de facto standard for web-based streaming video (over RTMP).|
|F4V|.flv|MPEG-4 Part 12|H.264|MP3, AAC|Replacement for FLV.|
|Vob|.vob|VOB|H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 or MPEG-1 Part 2|PCM, DTS, MPEG-1, Audio Layer II (MP2), or Dolby Digital (AC-3)|Files in VOB format have .vob filename extension and are typically stored in the VIDEO_TS folder at the root of a DVD. The VOB format is based on the MPEG program stream format.|

|Video alternative to GIF|.gifv|HTML|any|none|Not standardized, and not a real video file in the classical meaning since it merely references the real video file (e.g. a .webm file), which has to exist separately elsewhere. A .gifv "file" is simply a HTML webpage which includes a HTML5 video tag, where the video has no sound. As there were large communities online which create art using the medium of short soundless videos in GIF format, GIFV was created as a functionally similar replacement with vastly smaller filesizes than the inefficient GIF format.|

|.flac||A file format for the Free Lossless Audio Codec, an open-source lossless compression codec.|

|.sln||Signed Linear PCM format used by Asterisk. Prior to v.10 the standard formats were 16-bit Signed Linear PCM sampled at 8 kHz and at 16 kHz. With v.10 many more sampling rates were added.[9]|
|.tta||The True Audio, real-time lossless audio codec.|
|.voc|Creative Technology|The file format consists of a 26-byte header and a series of subsequent data blocks containing the audio information|
|.vox||The vox format most commonly uses the Dialogic ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) codec. Similar to other ADPCM formats, it compresses to 4-bits. Vox format files are similar to wave files except that the vox files contain no information about the file itself so the codec sample rate and number of channels must first be specified in order to play a vox file.|
|.wav||Standard audio file container format used mainly in Windows PCs. Commonly used for storing uncompressed (PCM), CD-quality sound files, which means that they can be large in size—around 10 MB per minute. Wave files can also contain data encoded with a variety of (lossy) codecs to reduce the file size (for example the GSM or MP3 formats). Wav files use a RIFF structure.|
